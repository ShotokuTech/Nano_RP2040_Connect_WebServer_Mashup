# Nano_RP2040_Connect_WebServer_Mashup
I was looking at this "Web Server AP mode with Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect" tutorial. I can see where they are going with this example sketch. I will mash up these two WiFiNINA example sketches and take the concept of this tutorial and make it one better. The tutorial creates a WiFi access point that you have to change your WiFi connection to. I want a web server that joins the WiFi network that I am on. That just makes so much more sense. Watch as we turn each Nano RP2040 Connect RGB LED on and off via a webpage hosted on the Nano RP2040 Connect.
